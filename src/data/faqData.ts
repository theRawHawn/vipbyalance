  {
    question: 'Who needs to register for GST in India?',
    answer:
      'GST registration is mandatory if your annual turnover exceeds ₹40 lakh (goods) or ₹20 lakh (services), or ₹10 lakh in special category states. It is also compulsory for e-commerce sellers, inter-state suppliers, and businesses making taxable supplies regardless of turnover. Byalance handles the entire registration process — from document collection to GSTIN issuance.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the penalty for late GST filing in India?',
    answer:
      'Late GST filing attracts a penalty of ₹50 per day (₹25 CGST + ₹25 SGST) for regular returns, with a maximum of ₹10,000 per return. For nil returns, the late fee is ₹20/day (₹10 each). Additionally, unpaid tax attracts 18% annual interest. Byalance files all returns before due dates to ensure you never pay unnecessary penalties.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is GSTR-2B and why does it matter?',
    answer:
      'GSTR-2B is the auto-generated Input Tax Credit (ITC) statement available on the GSTN portal. It shows the ITC you are eligible to claim based on your suppliers\' GSTR-1 filings. If you claim ITC not reflected in GSTR-2B, you risk interest and penalties during audits. Byalance reconciles your purchase records against GSTR-2B every month to ensure you claim only valid credits.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between GSTR-1, GSTR-3B, and GSTR-9?',
    answer:
      'GSTR-1 reports outward supplies (sales) — filed monthly or quarterly. GSTR-3B is a monthly summary return showing tax liability and ITC claimed — payment is made here. GSTR-9 is the annual GST return reconciling the whole financial year\'s data. Byalance files all three accurately and ensures GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B are reconciled before each submission.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I claim Input Tax Credit on all my purchases?',
    answer:
      'No. ITC can only be claimed on business-related purchases where the supplier has filed their GSTR-1 and the amount appears in your GSTR-2B. ITC is blocked on personal expenses, motor vehicles (with exceptions), food and beverages, and certain other categories under Section 17(5). Byalance reviews your purchase register monthly to maximise legitimate ITC and flag blocked credits.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is e-invoicing and does my business need it?',
    answer:
      'E-invoicing is mandatory for businesses with turnover above ₹5 crore. It requires generating invoices through the IRP (Invoice Registration Portal), which assigns a unique IRN and QR code. Byalance configures your e-invoicing setup, integrates with your accounting software, and ensures every invoice is IRP-compliant before it reaches your customer.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I switch from Composition Scheme to Regular GST?',
    answer:
      'To switch from Composition to Regular GST, you must file Form GST CMP-04 on the GSTN portal and begin filing GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B from the next month. You will also need to reverse ITC on opening stock. Byalance manages the entire transition — filing the withdrawal application, restructuring your compliance calendar, and updating your invoice format.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What GST services does Byalance provide in Bengaluru?',
    answer:
      'Byalance provides complete GST compliance services for businesses in Bengaluru and across Karnataka — including GST registration, monthly GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B filing, GSTR-9 annual return, ITC reconciliation (2B vs books), e-invoicing setup, e-way bill management, and resolution of GST notices and demands.

  {
    question: 'Who is required to file an Income Tax Return in India?',
    answer:
      'ITR filing is mandatory if your income exceeds the basic exemption limit (₹3 lakh under new regime / ₹2.5 lakh under old regime), if you have foreign assets, if TDS has been deducted and you want a refund, or if you want to carry forward losses. It is also mandatory for companies and LLPs regardless of profit. Byalance first checks your exact applicability before filing.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the last date to file ITR in India?',
    answer:
      'For salaried individuals and businesses not requiring audit, the ITR due date is 31st July of the assessment year. For businesses requiring a tax audit (turnover above ₹1 crore for business / ₹50 lakh for professionals), the deadline is 31st October. A belated return can be filed until 31st December. Byalance tracks all deadlines and sends you reminders to ensure timely filing.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the penalty for not filing ITR on time?',
    answer:
      'A late filing fee of ₹5,000 applies if you file after the due date (reduced to ₹1,000 if income is below ₹5 lakh). Beyond this, you lose the ability to carry forward business losses, and interest at 1% per month applies on unpaid tax under Section 234A. Byalance files your return before the deadline every year to avoid these costs.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Which ITR form should I file?',
    answer:
      'The correct ITR form depends on your income type: ITR-1 (Sahaj) for salaried individuals with income up to ₹50 lakh; ITR-2 for individuals with capital gains or foreign income; ITR-3 for business income; ITR-4 (Sugam) for presumptive taxation; ITR-5 for firms/LLPs; ITR-6 for companies; ITR-7 for trusts and political parties. Filing the wrong form results in a defective return notice. Byalance selects the correct form based on your income profile.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is Form 26AS and why should I check it before filing?',
    answer:
      'Form 26AS is a consolidated tax statement showing all TDS deducted on your income, advance tax paid, and self-assessment tax paid. The Income Tax Department matches your ITR against 26AS — any mismatch can trigger a scrutiny notice. Byalance cross-checks your Form 26AS, AIS (Annual Information Statement), and TIS (Taxpayer Information Summary) before filing to ensure your return is accurate and notice-proof.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What deductions can I claim to reduce my income tax?',
    answer:
      'Key deductions include: Section 80C (up to ₹1.5 lakh for PPF, ELSS, LIC, home loan principal); Section 80D (health insurance premiums up to ₹25,000–₹50,000); Section 24(b) (home loan interest up to ₹2 lakh); HRA exemption for rent paid; Section 80G for donations. Note these are available under the old tax regime. Byalance advises on the optimal regime (old vs new) for your income profile every year.',
  },
  {
    question: 'I received an income tax notice — what should I do?',
    answer:
      'Do not ignore an income tax notice. Common notices include Section 143(1) for minor mismatches, Section 139(9) for defective returns, and Section 143(2) for scrutiny. Each has a specific response deadline. Byalance reviews the notice, identifies the cause, prepares the response with supporting documents, and files it on the income tax portal within the due date.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can freelancers and self-employed professionals file ITR with Byalance?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Byalance specialises in ITR filing for freelancers, consultants, doctors, lawyers, architects, and other self-employed professionals. We compute your net income after deducting legitimate business expenses, check TDS deducted by clients against Form 26AS, advise on advance tax obligations, and file the correct ITR form (typically ITR-3 or ITR-4) before the due date.',

export const tdsFAQs: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    question: 'What is TDS and who needs to deduct it?',
    answer:
      'TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) is a mechanism where the payer deducts tax at specified rates before making certain payments — such as salary, rent, contractor fees, professional charges, and interest. Any business or individual whose accounts are audited, or who pays rent above ₹2.4 lakh/year, must deduct TDS. Byalance determines your exact TDS obligations and sets up a compliance system from day one.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the penalty for not deducting TDS?',
    answer:
      'If you fail to deduct TDS, you are liable for interest at 1% per month from the date TDS was due to be deducted. If TDS is deducted but not deposited to the government, interest is 1.5% per month. Additionally, the expense on which TDS was not deducted may be disallowed by the Income Tax Department under Section 40(a)(ia), increasing your tax liability significantly.',
  },
  {
    question: 'When is TDS due to be deposited to the government?',
    answer:
      'TDS deducted in any month (except March) must be deposited to the government by the 7th of the following month. For March deductions, the due date is 30th April. TDS returns (Form 24Q for salary, 26Q for non-salary) are filed quarterly — due on 31st July, 31st October, 31st January, and 31st May respectively. Byalance manages all challan payments and quarterly filings.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are Form 16 and Form 16A?',
    answer:
      'Form 16 is the TDS certificate issued by an employer to an employee for TDS deducted on salary — it contains salary details and tax computation. Form 16A is the TDS certificate for non-salary payments (contractor fees, rent, professional charges, etc.). Both must be issued within specified deadlines after the end of the financial year. Byalance generates both forms and ensures they are issued to payees on time.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is TAN and how do I apply for one?',
    answer:
      'TAN (Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number) is a 10-digit alphanumeric number mandatory for every entity required to deduct TDS. Without TAN, you cannot file TDS returns or deposit TDS challans. Applications are made through the NSDL portal using Form 49B. Byalance handles the entire TAN application process and typically secures your TAN within 7–10 working days.',
  },
  {
    question: 'I have a TDS default from a previous year — can Byalance fix it?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Byalance specialises in resolving prior TDS defaults — including unpaid interest, late filing fees under Section 234E, and demand notices from TRACES. We file correction statements, compute outstanding interest, assist with voluntary payment, and help respond to intimations from the Assessing Officer. Early resolution prevents the default from escalating into prosecution proceedings.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is Section 194N and does it apply to my business?',
    answer:
      'Section 194N requires banks and co-operative societies to deduct TDS at 2% on cash withdrawals exceeding ₹1 crore in a financial year (or 2% on amounts above ₹20 lakh if ITR has not been filed for 3 years). This applies to all account holders — individuals, businesses, and firms. Byalance advises on managing cash withdrawal patterns and ensures your ITR filing history is up to date to avoid the higher TDS rate.',

  {
    question: 'Is PF registration mandatory for all businesses in India?',

    question: 'What is the difference between accounting and bookkeeping?',
    answer:
      'Bookkeeping is the systematic recording of daily financial transactions — sales, purchases, payments, receipts. Accounting is the broader process of summarising, interpreting, and reporting that data — producing P&L statements, balance sheets, and tax-ready financials. Byalance handles both: clean bookkeeping on a monthly basis and formal accounting reports for compliance and business decisions.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How often should a small business do bookkeeping?',
    answer:
      'Small businesses should ideally do bookkeeping monthly. Quarterly or annual bookkeeping leads to backlogs, missed GST reconciliations, incorrect TDS filings, and poor cash flow visibility. Byalance works on a monthly cadence — all entries are recorded, bank statements reconciled, and reports shared within the first 10 working days of each month.',

  },
  {
    question: 'What is bank reconciliation and why is it important?',
    answer:
      'Bank reconciliation is the process of matching your accounting records with your bank statement to identify discrepancies — such as unrecorded transactions, bounced cheques, or bank charges. Without monthly reconciliation, your books may show incorrect cash balances leading to wrong GST filings or cash flow mismanagement. Byalance performs bank reconciliation every month as standard.',
